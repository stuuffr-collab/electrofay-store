📌 Prompt to Agent:
I want to upgrade the Product Detail Page of my gaming store to make it more professional and user-friendly.

Please implement the following UI/UX enhancements in a clean and responsive design:

✅ 1. Enhance Product Order Flow:
Replace the current "Order Now via WhatsApp" button with a normal “Order Now” button.

When the user clicks “Order Now”, show a confirmation modal or toast notification saying:
“✅ Product added to your cart successfully.”

Optionally, navigate user to the cart or keep shopping.

✅ 2. Improve Product Rating Display:
Show stars rating (e.g., ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐) and next to it the rating number (e.g., 4.9).

Add (123 reviews) next to the stars for realism.

✅ 3. Upgrade Product Specifications Section:
Display key specs with icons. Example:

🎧 Stereo Sound

🔋 Battery: 20,000mAh

📦 Includes case and charger

Alternatively, organize details into tabs:

“Description | Specifications | Shipping”

✅ 4. Improve Similar Products Display:
Make the Similar Products section a horizontal scroll carousel (Slider).

Add small tags like “New” or “Top Rated” on similar products.

Show 4 products at a time, scrollable on mobile.

✅ 5. Product Image Zoom:
Allow hover zoom on product image (or click to zoom in full view).

Add gallery with thumbnails for multiple product images.

✅ 6. Typography and Layout Enhancements:
Increase font size for product name and price slightly.

Add spacing between “Product Specs” and “Similar Products” sections.

Use Cairo Bold or Tajawal ExtraBold for product title.

✅ 7. Performance Optimization:
Make sure product images are compressed and served in WebP format for fast loading.

Optimize lazy loading for similar products.

✅ All changes should maintain a dark theme with gaming vibes, electric yellow for CTAs, and responsive design for both desktop and mobile.

Do not include any references to home appliances or unrelated categories – the store is 100% focused on gaming electronics only.

📢 After completing the changes, test mobile and desktop views. Let me know when done so I can review.
